# AnimeSubtitleGenerator

This Is a simple program I made in a bit for making Anime screenshots with custom subtitles for texting with people.
if anyone has any questions or suggestions feel free to ask me on my discord.

*How to use*
1. open the .exe or run the .py (or use the "open with" option in windows with the .exe).
2. select your image. (if you didn't use the open with option)
3. enter your subtitle text in the console.
4. the image is saved to your clipboard and you can just ctrl V it into a chat.
